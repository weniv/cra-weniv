# cra-template-cra-weniv


Custom Create React App template to generate projects with minimal files.

## Description

`cra-template-cra-weniv` is a custom template for [Create React App](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html#create-react-app) that addresses the issue of unnecessary files generated by default. It provides a minimal set of essential files and directory structures to kickstart your React project development.

## 📌 Features

- Removes unnecessary boilerplate files and directories
- Offers a clean starting point for your Create React App project
- Minimal configuration to get you up and running quickly

## 🛠 Installation

To use this template, you need to have `create-react-app` installed globally. If you don't have it installed, you can do so using:

```bash
npm install -g create-react-app
```

Once you have create-react-app installed, you can generate a new project using the cra-template-cra-weniv template:

```bash
npx create-react-app my-app --template cra-template-cra-weniv
```

This will create a new React app in the my-app directory using the custom template.

## ✨ Getting Started

Install the template as shown in the Installation section.
Navigate to the newly created project directory (my-app in the above example).
Start the development server:

```bash
npm start
```

This will launch the development server and open your app in your default web browser.

## 🗂️ Directory Structure

The template generates a project structure with only the essential files and directories:

```java

react-app/
├── public/
│   └── index.html
│   
├── src/
│   ├── App.js
│   └── index.js
├── node_modules
├── package.json
└── README.md
```

## Customization
Feel free to customize the template further according to your project's requirements. You can add additional files, configurations, and dependencies as needed.
